# About 
## Welcome to the SNU Clinical and Research laboratory for ALS/MND and Cell Therapy

The SNUH Clinical and Research laboratory for ALS/MND and Cell Therapy (a.k.a. SNU ALS/MND lab) is a laboratory established to identify the pathogenic mechanisms of intractable diseases as well as various neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and to develop a treatment and thus help patients suffering from rare and intractable diseases.

 Our lab is studying using up-to-date knowledge on molecular biology and immunology & genetics for the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases including ALS, the identification of pathogenic mechanisms and the development of treatment. The disease being studied with most priority is ALS, and the current study fields include the development of biomarkers for the diagnosis of hereditary & sporadic ALS and serial observation, and the development of ALS treatment through a study about the pathogenic mechanism of the disease and a study about autophagy as well as cell fusion. Other than that, various clinical studies are being conducted.

 Professor Kwang-Woo Lee, an emeritus professor of department of neurology of school of medicine at Seoul National University (SNU), who was a successive chief director of Korean Neurological Association before, has founded ALS/MND lab and laid its foundation, and currently professor Jung-Joon Sung, who is a successive professor of department of neurology of school of medicine at SNU, specialized in motor neuron disease and has completed a long-term training at Burnham Center for Neuroscience, Aging, and Stem Cell Research in the Burnham Institute for Medical Research, U.S.A., is holding office as a lab director. As Pf. Sung’s lead of the lab, the current basic science/clinical study system of ALS/MND lab has been established and the scale of lab has been enlarged by recruiting various researchers with doctoral and master’s degrees.

Afterwards, Professor Yoon-Ho Hong has joined and been leading the qualitative growth of the lab by playing a number of substantial roles in basic science and clinical studies, and performed a clinical study about myasthenia gravis and peripheral neuropathy. Particularly, he has been leading the study related to omics & RNA analysis since he has returned from the training at Harvard Medical School Boston Children’s Hospital. Afterwards, professor Sung-Min Kim, studying about demyelinating diseases, joined the lab and is studying about the associated diseases such as multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica. Professor Je-Young Shin, who has recently completed the training about myopathy at the national center for neurology and psychiatry in Japan and newly joined and performed a study about muscular dystrophy, now ALS/MND lab became a prominent comprehensive lab studying about neuromuscular diseases, performing studies about all neuromuscular diseases including motor neuron disease, peripheral nerve disease, myasthenia gravis, demyelinating disease, and muscle disease. 

Our lab has successfully performed various national study projects for the past several years, and is annually publishing many articles in SCI-level journals. Other than that, collaborator studies with various domestic and international institutions have been performed. Moreover, efforts to learn and share advanced knowledge have been made by attending annual international conference and holding symposium.

# Research 

Clinical Research

The clinical research of this lab is based on the medical examination and treatment of Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH), a national hospital with longest history and tradition in Korea. All professors in the lab holding offices as neurology professors at SNUH and Seoul Metropolitan Government Boramae Medical Center run by SNUH are treating patients with various neuromuscular diseases. In particular, ALS clinic has been famous as a specialized clinic, and provides clinical examples to other medical institutions.

 The number of both outpatients and inpatients treated in the neurology department at SNUH annually is greatest in Korea, and we are proud of playing a pivotal role in the treatment of serious, intractable and degenerative patients as a national tertiary medical center.

 ALS/MND lab annually performs various clinical studies based on these clinical experiences; studies about the characteristics of Korean patients have been conducted several times, and studies about the genotype-phenotype correlation as well as studies related to prognostic indicators of diseases have been conducted as well. Recently, an article based on the study using MUNE and MUNIX, electrophysiological testing related to motor unit estimation, has been published.

 Particularly, a clinical study in the hospital has been carried out annually through the clinical trials center at SNUH with the best facilities, along with the participation in international clinical trials.

As mentioned above, this ALS/MND lab has ability to perform both clinical and basic science trials successfully, and hopes to collaborate and interact with many researchers interested in neuromuscular diseases in the future.

Basic research

Six Ph.D members lead basic research in our lab.  As above mentioned, many basic researches have been conducted focusing on ALS in ALS/MND lab.  ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative condition pathologically characterized by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons from the brainstem motor nuclei, anterior horn of the spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. Oxidative injury, misfolded protein aggregates, altered axonal transport, impaired energy and calcium metabolism, excess of glutamate activity, malfunctioning mitochondria, and dysregulation of autophagy have all been implicated in motor neuron death in ALS; nonetheless, the pathogenic mechanism of and satisfactory treatment options for ALS remain unclear.

With advance in molecular biology, many researches have been conducted focusing on mutations in various genes such as Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), TAF15, EWSR1, FUS, and TDP-43 in ALS patients. In addition, the possibility of ALS pathomechanism of these mutations was widely proposed in many reports. So our research goals are pursuing how these diverse mutated genes lead to motor neuron cell death and unravelling specific molecular or cellular mechanism of these process. Our previous study suggested possible cellular mechanism of TDP-43 gene that causes neuronal cell death. In this process, phosphomimetic mutant TDP-43 (S409/410E) which induces Drosha instability and cytotoxicity in Neuro 2A cells.  Like TDP-43, abnormal aggregation of SOD1 is also compromised to neuronal viability. Using SOD1 transgenic mouse model and cell culture technique, we evaluated the role of aggregated SOD1 proteins in vitro and in vivo model. And our previous study revealed that intracellular propagation of misfolding of green fluorescent protein(GFP) was possible mediators of toxic process in wild type or mutant type SOD1 mice, and this process might lead to initiate mislocalization and aggregation of the protein. Based on our previous studies, now we’re extending our experience to explore pathogenetic mechanism of miRNAs in ALS.  We hope to make pivotal contribution to reveal the molecular pathomechanisms in ALS someday.
